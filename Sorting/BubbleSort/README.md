Bubble sort (sometimes referred to as sinking sort) - sorting by simple exchanges.
This is an algorithm that iterates through an array of elements and compares neighboring elements, swapping their values if necessary. These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements "bubble" up to the top of the list.
Asymptotics:
  Worst-case performance -      O(n²) comparisons
                                O(n²) swaps
                           
  Best-case performance -       O(n) comparisons
                                O(1) swaps
  
  Average performance -         O(n²) comparisons
                                O(n²) swaps

  Worst-case space complexity - O(n) total
                                O(1) auxiliary

  Optimal - No
